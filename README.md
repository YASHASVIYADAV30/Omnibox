## 🌟 What is OmniBox?

**OmniBox** is not just another script; it is your personal intelligent companion living in the command line. Built with **Python** and powered by **Google's Gemini AI**, it bridges the gap between natural language and system execution.

Unlike traditional assistants, OmniBox is natively **bilingual**, understanding commands in both **English and Hindi**. Whether you need to automate system tasks, fetch live weather data, read the news, or control media playback, OmniBox executes your intent instantly without requiring you to leave the terminal.
