## 🌟 Introduction

**OmniBox** is not just another script; it is a next-generation Command Line Interface (CLI) assistant designed to simplify your digital life. Powered by **Google Gemini AI**, it understands natural language in both **English and Hindi**, allowing you to control your system, access real-time data, and automate tasks without lifting a finger.

Unlike traditional assistants, OmniBox is natively **bilingual**. Whether you need to automate system tasks, fetch live weather data, read the news, or control media playback, OmniBox executes your intent instantly without requiring you to leave the terminal.
